# Thermal-Behaviour-of-the-Secondary-Rocket-Stage
The SpaceX Falcon-9 is a contemporary rocket designed to deliver payloads into space. The rocket
consists of two stages, a lower primary (for atmospheric flight) and upper secondary (for vacuum flight). 

In this report, the thermal behaviour of a simplified model of a simplified model of the secondary rocket stage of the SpaceX Falcon-9 is analysed using the analytical and numerical solution to the Laplace Equation and the numerical solution to the Poisson Equation.
